JWalletixTest
=============

Java Desktop Application Test for Walletix Java API 

Download the Jar file , Put a new file named walletixinfo.xml in the same location with the WalletixTest.jar file.

Edit the .xml file by adding:

```
<vendorInfo>
<vendorId>Your Vendor ID</vendorId>
<apiKey>Your API KEY</apiKey>
</vendorInfo>

```

If you launch the jar file without creating the walletixinfo.xml file,
a new xml file will be generated, edit it, then relaunch the application and 
start buying and selling on walletix sandbox :P


### Eclipse: 
Add the src directory to a new Eclipse project, 
Download [Walletix Java API file](https://github.com/cyounes/WalletixJavaApi) ,
include it in your project then build.
